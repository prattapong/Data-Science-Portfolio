## About Me

Hello! I'm Rattapong Pojpatinya, a data scientist with a passion for unraveling the stories hidden in data. 
My journey into the world of data science began with a fascination for how numbers and patterns can illuminate insights and inform decision-making.

**Education:**
- **Degree:** Bachelor Degree in Engineeering
- **University:** Chulalongkorn University

**What Excites Me About Data Science:**
What truly excites me about data science is the ability to transform raw data into meaningful narratives. It's like being a detective, extracting valuable information from the noise, and using it to drive informed decisions. I find joy in exploring innovative solutions to challenging problems, whether it's predicting future trends, uncovering patterns in text data, or creating impactful visualizations.

**Areas of Specialization:**
While I enjoy the entire data science spectrum, I have a particular interest in predictive modeling with neural network. I believe that the power of data lies not just in its volume but in the insights we can derive from it.

Feel free to explore my portfolio to see how I've applied these passions and skills to various projects. I'm always open to new challenges and collaborations, so don't hesitate to reach out!
